    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Ilish Bhuna is a traditional Bangladeshi dish made with Hilsa (Ilish) fish, known for its rich taste and soft
        texture. This dish is prepared by slow-cooking the fish with a blend of spices, onions, mustard oil, and green
        chilies, resulting in a thick, flavorful gravy. The bold flavors of mustard oil and fresh spices make this dish
        a beloved choice, often served with plain rice.

    <h2>Steps to Cook Ilish Bhuna</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the Hilsa fish pieces gently and pat them dry.</li>
            <li>Rub them with turmeric powder and salt. Let them sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 2: Fry the Fish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat mustard oil in a pan until it starts to smoke slightly. Reduce the heat.</li>
            <li>Fry the fish pieces lightly for 1-2 minutes on each side (avoid over-frying to keep them soft). Remove
                and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Masala</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the same oil, add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala. Stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes until the oil starts to separate.</li>
            <li>Add ½ cup water and bring it to a simmer.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 4: Cook the Fish in the Gravy</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently place the fried Hilsa fish into the gravy.</li>
            <li>Add green chilies and cover the pan. Let it cook on low heat for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse.</li>
            <li>Flip the fish pieces carefully to avoid breaking.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 5: Serve & Enjoy</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Once the gravy thickens, remove from heat and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with steamed rice for a classic Bangladeshi meal.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
